Coding Challenge: NYC Schools
GOAL: Verify candidate can provide a technical solution and follow instructions
REQUIREMENTS:
These requirements are rather high-level and vague. If details are omitted, it is because we will be happy with any of a wide variety of solutions. Don't worry about finding "the" solution. Feel free to be creative with the requirements. Your goal is to impress (but do so with clean code).

In order to prevent you from running down rabbit holes that are less important to us, try to prioritize the following:
What is Important
Share it through GITHUB
Proper function – requirements met.
Well-constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code (especially comment hacks or workarounds made in the interest of expediency (i.e. // given more time I would prefer to wrap this in a blah blah blah pattern blah blah )).
Proper separation of concerns and best-practice coding patterns.
Defensive code that graciously handles unexpected edge cases.

Bonus Points!
Unit Tests
Additional functionality – whatever you see fit.
iOS:
 “For applications that include CocoaPods with their project code, please commit the third-party frameworks to your repository (Even though this goes against the CocoaPods general rules).”  OR don’t use any third-party dependency if possible, that will allow app to build and run standalone.
Be sure to use safe area insets.
Make sure your app is compatible with iPhone X.
Use Swift as the primary language. 
As mentioned, you are not expected to function in a vacuum. Use all the online resources you can find.
